# CFD Intro

12 steps to Navier-Stokes following CFD courses from Lorena A. Barba at Boston U.
The courses are greate and are available online on
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30F4C5ABCE62CB61).

I used the C programming language to implement the pseudocode in the presentations.
To compile it, just type

    make

To run step `i`, just run

    ./i

## Changes

SOR instead of Jacobi for Laplace and Poisson equations.
Chorin projection method instead of direct method.
